# UKoin

Of all things hit by Brexit, the City of London was hit the hardest. Formerly
the financial capital of the EU (and with all the money that came with), the
loss of 'passporting' rights for financial products without an agreement to
replace it suddenly meant the finance industry had nothing to work with.
Furthermore, foreign investment (except perhaps by Russian oligarchs seeking to
launder money) also dropped off as the 'pipeline to Europe' dried up. This left
a lot of financial organizations without any work to do, facing imminent
closure.

Cryptocurrency became viewed as the solution to this problem. While the
mainstream finance industry took a dim view of cryptocurrencies in general, for
lack of other options, the City of London adopted it. This meant that they could
be the first major financial participants, and figured that this would also let
them avoid many of the problems with traditional financial products. Lobbyists
rapidly went to work, and several laws later (most of which were far too arcane
for anyone but a financial lawyer to decipher), cryptocurrency became the City's
biggest export.

However, existing cryptocurrencies were not considered entirely suitable as a
financial product, for a range of reasons, not least of all association with
black money. Additionally, the sweeping wave of Brexit-oriented nationalism
among lawmakers extended to everything. Much like the British pound was a major
form of economic sovereignty even when the UK _was_ in the EU, this combination
of nationalism and need led to a brand new cryptocurrency - the UKoin.
Underwritten by the Bank of England, UKoin gained financial legitimacy almost
overnight.

Throughout the UK, UKoin is enjoying more success than anywhere else, and is often used
as a digital currency. It's common to ask 'pounds or koin' when someone offers
to pay, and more often that not, 'koin, of course' is the answer you'll hear.
While it is rare for people in 'proper jobs' to be paid in UKoin, and more
traditional retailers still insist on pounds, it is _almost_ possible to exist
entirely on the basis of UKoin (as long as you enjoy a diet of delivery food and
buy almost everything online). This has also attracted a large number of DeFi investment (mostly from American
tech startups) to London, seen as an annoying inconvenience by the City, but a
huge financial windfall (mostly to themselves) by Westminster. Nothing showcases
the growing popularity of UKoin quite like Blockchainz, however; a white rapper
who came to prominence with his number one hit "Dem Bitches Love My UKoin". 

The only major detractors of UKoin are the Economic Crime Directorate of the
City of London Police. Indeed, the Detective Chief Superintendent of the ECD
continues to insist, both publically and privately, that UKoin has led to a
dramatic increase of financial crimes, and has made them harder to detect and
prosecute. However, those words seem to fall on deaf ears, both above, and
below.
